In recent years, photography contests have gained immense popularity,
providing a platform for photographers to showcase their creativity and
skills. However, the manual evaluation of thousands of submissions by
human judges is often time-consuming, subjective, and resourceintensive. This project presents an automated photography evaluation
system using machine learning techniques to assess and rank
photographs submitted to a contest. The proposed system utilizes deep
learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for
image quality assessment, composition analysis, subject matter
recognition, and aesthetics scoring. By analyzing various image
attributes, the system provides a comprehensive evaluation and ranks
the photographs based on predefined criteria such as technical quality,
composition, creativity, and overall aesthetic appeal. Additionally, the
system offers constructive feedback to photographers, enhancing their
skills. The developed web application integrates the machine learning
models, allowing users to submit photographs, receive feedback, and
view rankings in real time. This solution not only enhances the efficiency
and objectivity of the evaluation process but also encourages a wider
audience to participate in photography contests by providing instant,
unbiased, and transparent feedback
